# PNTD_miR-71
Deciphering the role of miR-71 in Echinococcus multilocularis early development in vitro


This repository contains:
- raw gene count table for E. multilocularis, samples and conditions described in the PNTD manuscript (as a .Rdata object)
- phenotypic data associated
- DESeq2 code to estimate DE genes
All data files and script files are provided to reproduce the results for the differential expression analysis performed at the mRNA level, with and without silencing miR-71.
